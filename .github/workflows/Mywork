# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab

steps:
      # 1. Standard: Check out the repository code
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      # 2. Critical: Set up the Lean 4 environment using the version specified in lakefile.toml
      # Note: This version must match the rev='...' in your lakefile.toml.
      - name: Setup Lean Toolchain
        uses: leanprover/setup-lean@v1
        with:
          version: '4.26.0-rc2' # Use the version you specified previously

      # 3. Essential: Download Mathlib and compile the project (The proof)
      - name: Build and Verify Proof
        run: |
          # Ensure all Mathlib dependencies are present
          lake update 
          # Compile the project and check for errors
          lake build
          
      # (Optional: Add a deployment step here to publish documentation or artifacts)
# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
